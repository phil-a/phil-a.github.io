<p>There were a few blogs out there that suggested to use the <strong>Quick Install</strong> method. However, at some <em>quick</em> first attempts I encountered a number of issues (mostly revolving around <a href="https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster">Buster</a> and its generate command failing after trying to fix links: <br>
<code>fixing links in  /Users/&lt;user&gt;/Development/Node/ghost-0.7.8/static/index.html</code>)</p>

<p>So I decided to do what any sane developer would do and to clone the entire repo (which will also come in handy when I have time to contribute to the project anyway).</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Make sure you have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> installed prior to doing any of the following. <br>
I cloned the repo in a folder of my choosing (renaming it 'Ghost') and then entered it:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost.git "Ghost"
cd ghost
</code></pre>

<p>Next, install the Grunt CLI globally if you haven't already:</p>

<pre><code>npm install -g grunt-cli
</code></pre>

<p>Time to install Ghost itself:</p>

<pre><code>npm install
</code></pre>

<p>And wait... <br>
Since we are going to be deploying for production we want to use the stable branch:</p>

<pre><code>git checkout stable
</code></pre>

<p>Next we build and minify for production:</p>

<pre><code>grunt init
grunt prod
</code></pre>

<p>Some more waiting while it spins... go read a book or something productive. <br>
When it is done we can finally run a local server to see if everything is running smoothly!</p>

<pre><code>npm start
</code></pre>

<p>Navigating to <a href="http://localhost:2368/">http://localhost:2368/</a> in your browser, you should see <br>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/code-phial/images/getting-ghost-running-on-github-with-buster/first.png" alt="Getting Ghost Running on Github (with Buster)"></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="settingupyourblog">Setting up your Blog</h2>

<p>When you navigate to <a href="http://localhost:2368/ghost">http://localhost:2368/ghost</a> you will be taken through a setup process for your blog. <br>
Make an account and when the process is finished you will see the admin screen: <br>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/code-phial/images/getting-ghost-running-on-github-with-buster/second.png" alt="Getting Ghost Running on Github (with Buster)"></p>

<p>As you can see it is simple and intuitive to understand, unlike some other blogging platforms that tend to overcomplicate matters.</p>

<p>Feel free to customize it to your liking. Add your <strong>logo</strong> and a <strong>background</strong>. You can change <strong>themes</strong> later (instructions below) or even create your very own.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="firstdeploywithbuster">First Deploy with Buster</h2>

<p>Firstly, you want to create a <a href="https://github.com/new">new Github repo</a> named &lt;your-user-name&gt;.github.io</p>

<p>Secondly you want to make sure pip is installed on your system:</p>

<pre><code>easy_install pip 
</code></pre>

<p>Use pip to install <a href="https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster">Buster</a>:</p>

<pre><code>pip install buster
</code></pre>

<p><code>cd</code> into your Ghost repo. We need to link Buster to your github repo and create that static folder:</p>

<pre><code>buster setup
https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;username&gt;.github.io.git
</code></pre>

<p>Since Buster generates static files from a local server, we need to make sure the server is running:</p>

<pre><code>npm start
</code></pre>

<p>and in a separate terminal window (in the same Ghost directory) run:</p>

<pre><code>buster generate --domain=http://localhost:2368/
</code></pre>

<p>This will generate static files from a local running server and places them inside a <strong>static</strong> folder from where the command was called.</p>

<p>One last step! You need to push it up to github in one of two ways:</p>

<pre><code>buster deploy 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>OR</strong> (like most sane people would do)</p>

<pre><code>cd static
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git push origin master
</code></pre>

<p>Check &lt;your-user-name&gt;.github.io to make sure it deployed correctly!</p>

<h2 id="blogworkflow">Blog Workflow</h2>

<ol>
<li>If it is not already obvious, you need to run your local server with <code>npm start</code> and navigate to <a href="http://localhost:2368/ghost">http://localhost:2368/ghost</a>  </li>
<li>Click new post and add your . When you're finished markdown and click "Publish now" on the top right corner  </li>
<li>Use the <code>buster generate --domain=http://localhost:2368/</code> command above to rebuild your updated static folder  </li>
<li>Deploy to github: <br>
<ul><li><code>buster deploy</code> </li>
<li>or <code>cd static/</code> and push it up to your remote on github normally.


<blockquote>
  Remember you need to have your local server running in the background before you use <code>buster generate</code></blockquote></li></ul></li>
  <li>Pray someone actually reads it. Or you can spam it all over social networks and piss people off with your wise-cracks. Your choice.</li>
  </ol>

<h2 id="customize">Customize</h2>

<ol>
<li>Find a theme <a href="http://marketplace.ghost.org/themes/free/">http://marketplace.ghost.org/themes/free/</a> and its Github repo  </li>
<li><code>cd &lt;path&gt;/Ghost/content/themes</code>  </li>
<li><code>git clone &lt;repo-of-theme&gt; "&lt;name-of-theme&gt;"</code> <br>
<ul><li>Example: <code>git clone https://github.com/oswaldoacauan/ghostium/ "ghostium"</code></li></ul></li>
<li><code>cd ../..</code> (Back to your Ghost root directory)  </li>
<li><code>npm start</code> (Run your server)  </li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://localhost:2368/ghost/settings/general/">http://localhost:2368/ghost/settings/general/</a> and select the newly installed theme from the drop down. Restart the server and you will see it.  </li>
<li>Dance!</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some themes have more configuration options than others. Such as Google Analytics, Disqus, etc.</p>

<p>Of course even if it doesn't you can add it yourself cause you're a smart cookie.

<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Ghost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!</p>

<p>Writing in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use <em>shortcuts</em> to <strong>style</strong> your content. For example, a list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Item number one</li>
<li>Item number two
<ul><li>A nested item</li></ul></li>
<li>A final item</li>
</ul>

<p>or with numbers!</p>

<ol>
<li>Remember to buy some milk  </li>
<li>Drink the milk  </li>
<li>Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="links">Links</h3>

<p>Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like <a href="http://ghost.org">http://ghost.org</a> - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to <a href="http://ghost.org">the Ghost website</a>. Neat.</p>

<h3 id="whataboutimages">What about Images?</h3>

<p>Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:</p>

<p><img src="https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png" alt="The Ghost Logo"></p>

<p>Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:</p>

<h3 id="quoting">Quoting</h3>

<p>Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. Perhaps you've started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ghost - Just a blogging platform</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="workingwithcode">Working with Code</h3>

<p>Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.</p>

<pre><code>.awesome-thing {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="readyforabreak">Ready for a Break?</h3>

<p>Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="advancedusage">Advanced Usage</h3>

<p>There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.</p>

<p><input type="text" placeholder="I'm an input field!"></p>

<p>That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
