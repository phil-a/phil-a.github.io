I <em>highly</em> recommend it for anyone that has experience in Javascript (though not required) and wants to learn how to develop mobile apps.</p>

<p>His tutorials are nearly flawless, and explains all the material intuitively in great detail. However, Parse recently decided to retire it's services and a lot of people have been forced to either switch to another BaaS, or deploy there own Parse-server.</p>

<p>I ran into a problem in his authentication section that I could not continue learning from his tutorials as I could not use Parse.com. So instead, I decided to deploy my own Parse-server on Heroku so that I could still closely follow along.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Parse Server is an open source version of the Parse backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The following tutorial is to help out the others that want to also finish his authentication tutorial due to the Parse shutdown.</strong></p>

<h3 id="setupparseserveronheroku">Set up Parse Server on Heroku</h3>

<p>Firstly, you have to get your own Parse-server up and running. I suggest using <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-a-parse-server-to-heroku#create-an-app">this tutorial from Heroku</a> as it is the easiest to understand. <em>*</em>Note that 'MongoLab' has recently changed their name to 'mLab'.* <br>
It's a very simple process that you should not encounter much trouble with. For testing, you can keep your appId as 'myAppId' and your masterKey as '' for now as you're just learning.</p>

<p>Once you have a successfully deployed server on Heroku you can test it by opening your terminal and running:</p>

<pre><code>curl -X POST \
   -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: myAppId" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{}' \
   https://&lt;YOUR-APP-NAME&gt;.herokuapp.com/parse/functions/hello
</code></pre>

<p>You should receive a response back:</p>

<pre><code>{"result":"Hi"}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="changestolecture59parseintegration">Changes to 'Lecture #59. Parse Integration'</h3>

<p>You can now continue with Stephen's tutorial and use parse in your application with some minor changes. In his tutorial you simply copy the <code>Parse.initialize()</code> with the keys from Parse.com. <br>
However now you have a server with your own keys, and you also need to specify the URL since you are not using Parse.com. Hence, your componentWillMount React function should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>componentWillMount: function() {
  Parse.initialize('myAppId','unused');
  Parse.serverURL = 'https://&lt;YOUR-APP-NAME&gt;.herokuapp.com/parse';
},
</code></pre>

<p>If you haven't changed any keys before deploying to Heroku you can simply copy the above function. Otherwise, just replace with your keys.</p>

<p>Following to Stephen's '#60 Parse Installation' tutorial you should be able to receive a similar error message that reads <code>Invalid username/password</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/code-phial/images/using-parse-server-with-react-native/ErrorConsole.png" alt="Using a Parse-server with React Native"></p>

<p>If not, then either you have not configured your server properly. Make sure that you have not forgotten <code>'/parse'</code> at the end of the URL. You should be able to display the error message in your application.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/code-phial/images/using-parse-server-with-react-native/ErrorMessageShow.gif" alt="Using a Parse-server with React Native"></p>

<h3 id="changestolecture61usersignin">Changes to 'Lecture #61 - User Sign In'</h3>

<p>The next time you will have an issue, is using the Parse.com Dashboard which you will not be able to access, obviously. The workaround is simply using your Parse server to create a new user:</p>

<pre><code>curl -X POST \
  -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: myAppId" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"TEST","password":"PASSWORD"}' \
  http://&lt;YOUR-APP-NAME&gt;.herokuapp.com/parse/classes/_User
</code></pre>

<p>This should return a _User object on creation:</p>

<pre><code>{"objectId":"FZWXZCNnjk","createdAt":"2016-03-31T04:12:45.137Z","sessionToken":"r:f728e2a4314bd1f5d830f7aaa29b0bb8"}
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure it has a sessionToken in the object, otherwise you have mistyped something (most likely the class name <code>_User</code>)</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/code-phial/images/using-parse-server-with-react-native/LoginSuccess.gif" alt="Using a Parse-server with React Native"></p>

<h3 id="thatsit">That's it!</h3>

<p>From here you should be able to finish up the tutorial without any more problems! Thanks again to Stephen for <a href="https://www.udemy.com/reactnative/learn/v4/overview">this fantastic tutorial</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Getting Started with React Native]]></title><description><![CDATA[A simple set-up guide to getting React Native up and running on your system and testing using iOS and Android.]]></description><link>www.alekseev.ca/blog/getting-started-with-react-native/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">cef3181a-4ee4-435c-9168-27a9fc86e48f</guid><category><![CDATA[react-native]]></category><category><![CDATA[mobile development]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Philip Alekseev]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 20 Mar 2016 01:34:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="www.alekseev.ca/blog/content/images/2016/03/react-native.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<img src="www.alekseev.ca/blog/content/images/2016/03/react-native.png" alt="Getting Started with React Native"><p>I decided to dive head-first into learning React Native today. Why, you ask, do I not just use Xcode and learn Swift (which I have heard was really great, actually) and then also use Android Studio and code in Java.</p>

<p>That basically answers the question. <strong>Cause I'm lazy.</strong> I want to develop native mobile apps, but yet I would basically have to rewrite the front-end twice in two different languages. That's quite a pain in the ass. <br>
I know it <em>could</em> possibly make me a better programmer down the road. And my expertise <em>could</em> be more in demand in the future (maybe, but also maybe not). </p>

<p>However, I want to develop and release to multiple platforms with as little 'mode-switching' in my mind as possible right now. For this consistency, I think <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> will take off. Plus, there is the bonus feature of not having to wait 2 hours for compilation every time you make a change, which is <em>quite nice</em>. But, even if React Native hits an iceberg and sinks, React will still be around for web developers. This is also <em>quite nice</em> to fall-back on.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="setuposx">Setup (OSX)</h2>

<p>You will need to install <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&amp;mt=12">Xcode</a> and the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">Android Studio SDK</a> installed.</p>

<p>You should also have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> installed on your system. I suggest using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nvm">nvm</a> to switch between versions as React Native may require different versions from your other applications. <br>
There are multiple ways to install nvm, and how you do it I'll leave to personal preference.</p>

<p>Next you need to install watchman which is a file watching service built by Facebook:</p>

<pre><code>brew install watchman
</code></pre>

<p>Next, you need to install the React Native client:</p>

<pre><code>npm install -g react-native-cli
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2 id="generatingaproject">Generating a Project</h2>

<p>Thereis just one simple command to generate a new React Native project:</p>

<pre><code>react-native init &lt;name-of-project&gt;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

<p>By default, React Native builds a running application. <br>
Launch your server by running:</p>

<pre><code>npm start
</code></pre>

<p>If you have your Xcode and Android Studio setup correctly you can launch the emulators or run it directly on the device.  </p>

<h3 id="ios">iOS</h3>

<pre><code>react-native run-ios
</code></pre>

<p>This will launch an iOS emulator on your machine, which will you will see the following page on it: <br>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/code-phial/images/getting-started-with-react-native/react-native-first-run.png" alt="Getting Started with React Native"></p>

<h3 id="android">Android</h3>

<p>You can run a similar command for Android:</p>

<pre><code>react-native run-android
</code></pre>

<p>However, you may get a red error screen if it is not set up on the correct IP address. To fix this you need to get to the <strong>dev menu by pressing Cmd+D or shaking the physical device</strong></p>

<p>Then click <strong>Dev Settings</strong> and under "Debugging", select <strong>"Debug server host &amp; port for device"</strong> <br>
Enter: <code>&lt;Your_ip_address&gt;:8081</code></p>

<p>To find out the IP address of your computer (from System Preferences > Network <strong>OR</strong> you can run <code>$ ifconfig | grep 'inet'</code>) and make sure your device is on the same network.</p>

<p>Reload it and you should see the same welcome screen above!</p>

<p>There were a few blogs out there that suggested to use the <strong>Quick Install</strong> method. However, at some <em>quick</em> first attempts I encountered a number of issues (mostly revolving around <a href="https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster">Buster</a> and its generate command failing after trying to fix links: <br>
<code>fixing links in  /Users/&lt;user&gt;/Development/Node/ghost-0.7.8/static/index.html</code>)</p>

<p>So I decided to do what any sane developer would do and to clone the entire repo (which will also come in handy when I have time to contribute to the project anyway).</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Make sure you have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> installed prior to doing any of the following. <br>
I cloned the repo in a folder of my choosing (renaming it 'Ghost') and then entered it:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost.git "Ghost"
cd ghost
</code></pre>

<p>Next, install the Grunt CLI globally if you haven't already:</p>

<pre><code>npm install -g grunt-cli
</code></pre>

<p>Time to install Ghost itself:</p>

<pre><code>npm install
</code></pre>

<p>And wait... <br>
Since we are going to be deploying for production we want to use the stable branch:</p>

<pre><code>git checkout stable
</code></pre>

<p>Next we build and minify for production:</p>

<pre><code>grunt init
grunt prod
</code></pre>

<p>Some more waiting while it spins... go read a book or something productive. <br>
When it is done we can finally run a local server to see if everything is running smoothly!</p>

<pre><code>npm start
</code></pre>

<h2 id="settingupyourblog">Setting up your Blog</h2>

<p>When you navigate to <a href="www.alekseev.ca/blog/ghost">www.alekseev.ca/blog/ghost</a> you will be taken through a setup process for your blog. <br>
Make an account and when the process is finished you will see the admin screen: <br>

<p>As you can see it is simple and intuitive to understand, unlike some other blogging platforms that tend to overcomplicate matters.</p>

<p>Feel free to customize it to your liking. Add your <strong>logo</strong> and a <strong>background</strong>. You can change <strong>themes</strong> later (instructions below) or even create your very own.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="firstdeploywithbuster">First Deploy with Buster</h2>

<p>Firstly, you want to create a <a href="https://github.com/new">new Github repo</a> named &lt;your-user-name&gt;.github.io</p>

<p>Secondly you want to make sure pip is installed on your system:</p>

<pre><code>easy_install pip 
</code></pre>

<p>Use pip to install <a href="https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster">Buster</a>:</p>

<pre><code>pip install buster
</code></pre>

<p><code>cd</code> into your Ghost repo. We need to link Buster to your github repo and create that static folder:</p>

<pre><code>buster setup
https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;username&gt;.github.io.git
</code></pre>

<p>Since Buster generates static files from a local server, we need to make sure the server is running:</p>

<pre><code>npm start
</code></pre>

<p>and in a separate terminal window (in the same Ghost directory) run:</p>

<pre><code>buster generate --domain=www.alekseev.ca/blog/
</code></pre>

<p>This will generate static files from a local running server and places them inside a <strong>static</strong> folder from where the command was called.</p>

<p>One last step! You need to push it up to github in one of two ways:</p>

<pre><code>buster deploy 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>OR</strong> (like most sane people would do)</p>

<pre><code>cd static
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git push origin master
</code></pre>

<p>Check &lt;your-user-name&gt;.github.io to make sure it deployed correctly!</p>

<h2 id="blogworkflow">Blog Workflow</h2>

<ol>
<li>If it is not already obvious, you need to run your local server with <code>npm start</code> and navigate to <a href="www.alekseev.ca/blog/ghost">www.alekseev.ca/blog/ghost</a>  </li>
<li>Click new post and add your . When you're finished markdown and click "Publish now" on the top right corner  </li>
<li>Use the <code>buster generate --domain=www.alekseev.ca/blog/</code> command above to rebuild your updated static folder  </li>
<li>Deploy to github: <br>
<ul><li><code>buster deploy</code> </li>
<li>or <code>cd static/</code> and push it up to your remote on github normally.


<blockquote>
  Remember you need to have your local server running in the background before you use <code>buster generate</code></blockquote></li></ul></li>
  <li>Pray someone actually reads it. Or you can spam it all over social networks and piss people off with your wise-cracks. Your choice.</li>
  </ol>
  <hr>


<h2 id="customize">Customize</h2>

<ol>
<li>Find a theme <a href="http://marketplace.ghost.org/themes/free/">http://marketplace.ghost.org/themes/free/</a> and its Github repo  </li>
<li><code>cd &lt;path&gt;/Ghost/content/themes</code>  </li>
<li><code>git clone &lt;repo-of-theme&gt; "&lt;name-of-theme&gt;"</code> <br>
<ul><li>Example: <code>git clone https://github.com/oswaldoacauan/ghostium/ "ghostium"</code></li></ul></li>
<li><code>cd ../..</code> (Back to your Ghost root directory)  </li>
<li><code>npm start</code> (Run your server)  </li>
<li>Go to <a href="www.alekseev.ca/blog/ghost/settings/general/">www.alekseev.ca/blog/ghost/settings/general/</a> and select the newly installed theme from the drop down. Restart the server and you will see it.  </li>
<li>Dance!</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Ghost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!</p>

<p>Writing in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use <em>shortcuts</em> to <strong>style</strong> your content. For example, a list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Item number one</li>
<li>Item number two
<ul><li>A nested item</li></ul></li>
<li>A final item</li>
</ul>

<p>or with numbers!</p>

<ol>
<li>Remember to buy some milk  </li>
<li>Drink the milk  </li>
<li>Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="links">Links</h3>

<p>Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like <a href="http://ghost.org">http://ghost.org</a> - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to <a href="http://ghost.org">the Ghost website</a>. Neat.</p>

<h3 id="whataboutimages">What about Images?</h3>

<p>Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:</p>

<p><img src="https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png" alt="The Ghost Logo"></p>

<p>Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:</p>

<h3 id="quoting">Quoting</h3>

<p>Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. Perhaps you've started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ghost - Just a blogging platform</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="workingwithcode">Working with Code</h3>

<p>Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.</p>

<pre><code>.awesome-thing {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="readyforabreak">Ready for a Break?</h3>

<p>Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="advancedusage">Advanced Usage</h3>

<p>There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.</p>

<p><input type="text" placeholder="I'm an input field!"></p>

<p>That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
